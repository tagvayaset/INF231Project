                    Today Almaty is called the “southern capital”, because in terms of the intensity of economic, social and cultural life, it is really a capital city. </p>
                <p class="almt"> Almaty is located in the foothills of the Zailiysky Alatau, so from almost anywhere in the city in clear weather you can see the mountain peaks encircling Almaty from the south.
                    The fact that the city is located on an inclined surface is also connected with the geographical position, therefore, among the landmarks used by Almaty residents, the concepts of “down” and “up” are the most common.</p>

                    Since the mid-50s, Shymbulak has been a training base for Soviet skiers,
                    the championships of the USSR and Kazakhstan were held on its slopes.
                    Every year in early February, skiers competed in Shymbulak, playing
                   
                    "Prize of Alexandra Artemenko", 11-time champion of the USSR, master of sports,
                    participants in the 1956 Olympic Games. Anyone who was skiing or at least watched the training of athletes,
                    they know well how much time and effort the athlete spent on lifting. The pioneers had to climb the mountain for 3 hours,
                    The descent took only 15 minutes. Equipment came to the rescue of athletes overcoming the ascent.</a>

                The most popular months for a holiday on the lake are July, August and September. However, many people come here all year round, because even in winter Issyk has a charming power. They say that the lake has a real character, its water constantly changes color depending on the weather. When the sky frowns, then the lake turns gray, and under the bright sunlight, the water turns blue.

                Route: along the Kuldzha highway to the city of Issyk, along the main road we move to the market, then after passing the bridge, turn right at the second traffic light (traffic light with an arrow). Then we go up, not turning anywhere. By car, you can drive almost to the very lake - only the last 3-4 km must be walked.
